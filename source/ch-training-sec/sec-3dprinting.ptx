  <title>3D Printing</title>

  <p> 3D printing is an additive manufacturing process which creates 3-dimensional objects from digital files.
     This is done by ‘slicing’ three dimensional models into layers using slicing software, 
     then printing them out in layers using a printer. 
  </p>
  <p> The models are created using CAD (Computer Aided Design) software. The two most common commercially available types of 3D printing are FDM and SLA.</p>

    <title>FDM Printing</title>
    <p>
        Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) utilized thermoplastic filament which is heated, extruded, and put down in layers on a bed. FDM printing is an excellent
        choice for most common prints.

    <title>SLA Printing</title>
    <p>
        Stereolithography (SLA) printing uses UV light (typically a laser) to convert resin into a solid plastic. 
        This is also done in layers, but the bed is inverted, and the model is pulled upward out of a vat of resin.
        SLA printing is an excellent choice to pieces with small details or complex geometries such as figurines.
