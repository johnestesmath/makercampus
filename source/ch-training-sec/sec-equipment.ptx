      Members may only use consumable lab materials with permission.  Training is required before use rights are granted.

    <title>Purchasing</title>
    The Faculty Advisors do their best to provide consumables such as PLA filament and 
    UV resin, wood, etc. Beyond what is provided in the lab, materials (especially if exotic) 
    will be purchased by the member using it.

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-cleanup">
    <title>Clean Up</title>
    <p>
      Follow all clean-up procedures learned during training. In general, all filament rolls must 
      be put back into the correct air-tight bin, all resin printers closed, all resin
       cleaned off, all surfaced cleaned, and floors swept if appropriate to the mess.
    </p>

    <p>
      Furthermore, all tools must be put away and equipment powered down after use. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Membership may be revoked if clean-up is continuously avoided.
