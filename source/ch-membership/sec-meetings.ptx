        The Maker Campus is a community, and good communication is the foundation of
        good community.

    <p>
        Faculty Advisors will utilize one or more of the communication methods 
        (see “Communications” below) to call a meeting. Members are expected to
         attend all meetings. If a member is not able to attend due to a conflict, 
         notification must be given to a Faculty Advisor. Failure to notify may result 
         in the removal of membership status.

        The Maker Campus Team via Microsoft Teams is the best way to keep current with
        Maker Campus news and information. Here members can share ideas and projects they are
        working on, collaborate with a project-team, and connect with other Maker Campus
        members.  Members will gain access to this channel upon paying the membership fee. 
        Please inform a Faculty Advisor 
        if you have paid the fee and are not granted access.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Each week the Maker Campus sends out an update in the form of an email newsletter. 
        This newsletter announces meetings, changes, new materials and equipment, and other 
        pertinent information. Please inform a Faculty Advisor of you have paid the fee and 
        are not receiving the newsletter.
    </p>

    <p>
        Faculty Advisors or Administrative Assistants may also send out emails regarding 
        information not included in the Newsletter or posted on Teams; or reminders of that information.
