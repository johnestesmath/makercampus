  <title>Maker Culture</title>

  <p> The Maker Culture (aka Maker Movement) is a rapidly growing social movement centered around 
    the idea of physical production. It is a loose confederation comprised of artists, 
    scientists, and laborers from various trades. Maker communities focus on hands-on 
    learning and the creative incorporation of current technology to better society. 
    Open source and collaborative, this movement seeks to increase access to current technology, 
    ideas, and resources for everyone.

  <p>
    This movement is an exercise in sharing and culture-building. Methodologically the Biblical 
    Worldview, with its focus on service and charity, can: 1) find ways to connect with and evangelize 
    within the Maker Movement and 2) collaborate with others to improve the general condition of 
    those outside the movement.
