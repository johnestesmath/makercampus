  <title>Service Projects</title>

  <p> Throughout the year, the Maker Campus is approached by various individuals and 
    groups within and outside Belhaven University for service projects. These projects 
    are voluntary, facilitated by a Faculty Advisor, and led by one or more members.    </p>
